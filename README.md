# Mega Nomz
Mega Nomz (temporary name) is a recipe search database. 

The goal of this project is to create an online resource for all of the recipes that I've collected over the years, and to organize them in a way that allows me to search via:
- ingredients
- cuisine (ex: Thai, American)
- type (ex: soup, stirfry, casserole)
- meal prep-friendly (i.e. could I make a big batch and freeze most of it for later)
- other qualities (hot, cold, comfort, healthy, light)
- pictures!

## Future
As this project moves farther along, I'd like to add the following:
- A built-in web scraper. Provide the URL of an existing recipe and it will be added to the user's personal database. Something like [this](https://github.com/hhursev/recipe-scrapers).
- Macro/calorie-counting, specifically in the context of designing a meal plan.

## Inspiration

I like to cook, but sometimes I get stuck in a rut. These have been some real-life examples that have inspired the creation of this project:

_This is the 13th week in a row that I've gotten carrots in my farm box. How can I prepare them in a unique way?_

_Mint leaves? What the heck do I do with these?!_

_These tomatoes are going bad. I need to use them asap._

_Idk what I want, but I'll know it when I see it. I'll just scroll through the photos._

_It's so cold outside. I want something that is comforting and warm._
